The Boeing 737 MAX incidents involved a series of crashes that occurred for many reasons, violating core engineering and ethical principles. Below these failures are investigated, key ethical issues are identified and solutions to prevent this in the future are given. The ethical concerns that are addressed can be be broken into three main questions: Should Boeing have downplayed the importance of MCAS or left it out of plane documentation? What was the effect of Boeing not taking original responsibility for the crashes? And should competition dictate design timelines and engineering decisions? 	

Boeing downplaying the importance of MCAS and leaving it out of documentation was an underlying catalyst for the crashes. This decision impacted many stakeholders, including passengers, flight crews, airlines, the FAA and the general public. It initiated a chain of failures and the exclusion of MCAS must be considered first. 

Pilots were not informed about MCAS, which fundamentally changed how the plane behaved compared to earlier 737 models. This lack of knowledge shows a major loophole exploited by Boeing, as they failed to inform a critical stakeholder of the change. Installing MCAS introduced many new risks without any fallback safety plans. One major risk was that MCAS could activate based on a single angle of attack sensor input. If that sensor was to fail, MCAS could repeatedly force the aircraft to nose dive. This was seen in the Lion Air Flight 610, as pilots did not recognize the cause of the nose dive and therefore did not know how to properly respond. This lack of transparency directly compromised safety of everyone. 

By examining the ASME Canons of Ethics, it is clear that protecting human life and safety must always come before company loyalty and reputation management. Transparency about system risks is essential to maintain public trust and prevent harm. Although individual engineers may have lacked authority to make full design changes, and redesigns are expensive, these ethical principles must be prioritized no matter the pressure involved. 

Boeing did not take original responsibility for the crash, and had they later crashes could have been prevented. These failures show Boeing’s liability and fault in the incidents. The FAA is also responsible as they did not have full understanding of Boeing’s new aircraft systems and failed in both pre and post crash risk assessment. 

It must be examined why the FAA delegated so much certification authority to Boeing and how MCAS was classified as a “minor change”. This classification minimized scrutiny and allowed a critical safety system to be avoided. 

Loyalty and commitment to one’s employer can cause conflict with conduct and honesty. Engineers may be placed under pressure to avoid admitting fault in order to protect Boeing’s reputation, financial and legal standing even though ethical practices require acknowledging design flaws to prevent future failures. Integrity and public safety must always outweigh corporate image and profit. 
	
Competition played a leading role in the MCAS implementation. Boeing felt pressure to level the playing field with competitors, which caused them to rush design decisions and jump through regulatory loopholes. Boeing’s effort to reduce pilot differences between 737 MAX and earlier models led to no new pilot training requirements and reduced visibility between system changes. 

Boeing’s internal culture and business pressures also played a major role, as production speed and cost savings were prioritized over transparency and safety. There are missing facts in this situation, such as Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg communication internally about balancing deadlines and safety. Regardless of these unknowns, public safety cannot be compromised for profit or schedule . 

Ethical decision making requires delaying production when necessary. Strict schedules, limited design decision making and budget compliance cause engineers to not seek independent reviews. This undermines the principle of safety first that should guide every engineering decision. 

A clear solution to this crisis was that Boeing engineers and management should have communicated MCAS risks clearly to airline regulators and pilots. Safety critical features must always be discussed in detail and Boeing should have accepted responsibility dor MCAS immediately after the first crash, and internal board reviews should be used to create accountability. MCAS details should have been included in pilot training and manuals as full disclosure ensures pilot readiness and protects public safety. Promoting personal accountability and ethical reflection in engineering training as well as teaching engineers how to escalate certification concerns when ethical conflicts arise. Ethical responsibilities must be reinforced through clear technical documentation, cross team verification, and independent review of safety systems and regulatory communication.
